In this paper, we propose \DeepVis, a highly scalable integrity verification framework that applies hash-based spatial mapping for constant-time inference and integrates local maximum detection to resolve the statistical asymmetry between diffuse updates and sparse attacks. \DeepVis transforms file system monitoring from a linear scanning problem into a fixed-size computer vision problem which decouples verification complexity from the file count. Our evaluations on production infrastructure across Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian show that \DeepVis achieves an F1-score of 0.96 with zero false positives, enables 168 times more frequent monitoring than traditional FIM, and maintains zero runtime overhead. These results demonstrate that \DeepVis effectively addresses the scalability bottlenecks and alert fatigue of prior approaches, offering a practical solution for continuous integrity verification in hyperscale distributed systems.
