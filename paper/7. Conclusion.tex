\section{Conclusion}
\label{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose \DeepVis, a highly scalable integrity verification framework that applies hash-based spatial mapping for fast inference and integrates local maximum detection to resolve the statistical asymmetry between diffuse updates and sparse attacks. \DeepVis transforms file system monitoring from a linear scanning problem into a fixed-size computer vision problem which decouples verification complexity from the file count. Our evaluations on production infrastructure across Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian show that \DeepVis achieves an F1-score of 0.96 with zero false positives on curated attack scenarios, enables 168 times more frequent monitoring than traditional FIM, and maintains negligible runtime overhead (+2\% P99 latency, +1.4\% CPU). These results demonstrate that \DeepVis effectively addresses the scalability bottlenecks and alert fatigue of prior approaches, offering a practical solution for continuous integrity verification in hyperscale distributed systems.

\noindent\textbf{Artifact Availability.} To support reproducibility, we will release the following upon publication: (1) the Rust-based scanner core with HMAC-SHA256 spatial mapping, (2) the 1$\times$1 CAE training and inference pipeline (PyTorch/ONNX), (3) synthetic churn generators and \texttt{fio} configuration files, and (4) feature extraction scripts. Malware samples are referenced via SHA-256 hashes from public datasets.
