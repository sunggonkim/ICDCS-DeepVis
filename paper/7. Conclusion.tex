\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose \DeepVis, a high-throughput integrity verification framework that utilizes spatial hash projection to transform unordered file systems into fixed-size tensors and integrates local maximum detection to preserve sparse attack signals against diffuse system updates. Our evaluations on production infrastructure show that \DeepVis achieves a $121.4\times$ throughput improvement (15,789 files/s) over traditional FIM tools under cold cache conditions, attains 97.1\% recall with a 0.3\% false positive rate, and maintains negligible runtime overhead (+2\% P99 latency) via asynchronous I/O. These results demonstrate that \DeepVis effectively addresses the scalability limits of prior monitoring systems, offering a high-speed and practical solution for integrity auditing in distributed systems.
