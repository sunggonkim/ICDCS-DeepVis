In this paper, we design and implement \DeepVis, a high-throughput integrity verification framework based on a spatial hash projection architecture. By transforming unordered file systems into fixed-size tensors and integrating local maximum detection, we optimize the detection logic to preserve sparse attack signals against diffuse system updates. We evaluate \DeepVis on production infrastructure and show that it achieves 97.1\% recall with a 0.3\% false positive rate, surpassing the scalability limits of traditional FIM with a 121.4$\times$ throughput improvement (15,789 files/s) under cold cache conditions. This is achieved by decoupling inference complexity from file count and maintaining negligible runtime overhead (+2\% P99 latency) through asynchronous I/O pipelining.
