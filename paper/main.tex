\begin{abstract}
This paper presents \DeepVis, a high-throughput integrity verification system designed to improve scalability and reduce overhead in hyperscale storage environments.
Our key idea is to leverage a spatial hash projection architecture, enabling highly parallelized metadata processing while maintaining detection accuracy via a stable tensor representation.
Specifically, \DeepVis first introduces an asynchronous snapshot engine that leverages high-performance I/O interfaces to maximize ingestion rates, allowing the system to rapidly capture file system states.
Second, \DeepVis devises a lock-free tensor mapping pipeline, where metadata processing is sharded across processor cores to eliminate contention and achieve linear scalability.
Finally, \DeepVis adopts a spatial anomaly detection approach, enabling the identification of sparse attack signals even amidst significant background noise caused by legitimate system updates.
We implement \DeepVis with these three techniques and evaluate its performance on a production-grade cloud VM with 4 vCPUs and NVMe storage.
Our evaluation results show that \DeepVis achieves a scan rate of up to 50,000 files/sec and improves verification throughput by up to 2.6$\times$ and 100$\times$ compared with AIDE and signature-based tools, respectively, while maintaining a CPU overhead of less than 5\%.
