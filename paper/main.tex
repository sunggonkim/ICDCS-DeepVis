\begin{abstract}
Integrity verification in hyperscale storage systems faces a fundamental trade-off between scanning throughput and detection granularity. Traditional hash-based scanners suffer from $O(N)$ I/O bottlenecks, while provenance-based trackers impose prohibitive context-switching overheads (5--20\% runtime penalty). We present \DeepVis, a high-throughput integrity verification system designed for continuous anomaly detection in distributed environments.

Unlike prior approaches that treat file systems as fragile sorted sequences, \DeepVis implements a \textit{parallelized hash-to-tensor projection engine} that maps unstructured metadata streams into fixed-size spatial representations with $O(1)$ inference complexity. Our system architecture features three key optimizations: (1) an \textit{asynchronous snapshot engine} leveraging \texttt{io\_uring} to saturate NVMe bandwidth at 2.1M files/sec; (2) a \textit{lock-free tensor mapping} pipeline using thread-local sharding to eliminate write contention; and (3) a \textit{spatial anomaly isolator} that detects sparse attacks even during heavy system churn.

We evaluate \DeepVis using a longitudinal trace reconstructed from 5 years of operational history (2019--2024), comprising 150,000+ real-world package updates across Ubuntu and CentOS production fleets. Results demonstrate drift resilience against legitimate churn (0.0\% false positives over 5,000 consecutive updates) while isolating 98\% of injected anomalies---even when coinciding with major kernel upgrades. Micro-benchmarks show our snapshot engine outperforms \texttt{rsync} by 14$\times$ and AIDE by 85$\times$, enabling sub-second verification for million-file systems with $<$0.5\% CPU impact.
